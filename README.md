# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project built in Vanilla Javascript. It is expanding cards.
This app has 7 different images which you can click, also I added in this project dark theme functionality.

Inspiration to this project I got from udemy course created by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.
